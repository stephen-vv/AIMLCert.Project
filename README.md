# Titanic Survival Prediction 


## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT

This project uses a random forest classifier to predict whether a passenger would have survived or perished using publicly available from the passengers of the Titanic upon it's maiden voyage.

## DATA

The dataset is freely available from kaggle.com and consists of passenger information from the registry of passengers present aboard the Titanic upon it's maiden voyage.

## MODEL 

The model is a random forest classifier, and it works well for this application as this is a classification problem and the random forest can detect any relationships between input and output characteristics, and performs well on the training set.

## RESULTS

The results on the training set are as follows

Confusion Matrix:
 [[545   4]
 [ 14 328]]

Accuracy:  0.9797979797979798
Specificity:  0.9927140255009107
